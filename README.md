# Conway's Game of Life

A simple zero player game, made in Java with Swing, that follows the rules of the original game devised by John Conway

    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
